/**
[ ] `accountGenerator`: You'll be provided with a function called `accountGenerator` in `src/closures.js`. Please add more functionality:

- [ ] Add function `getBalance` that returns the current balance
- [ ] Change `withdraw` to return a transaction object (see below)
- [ ] Change `deposit` to return a transaction object (see below)
- [ ] Implement a function `transactionHistory` to get the last `n` withdrawals or deposits ðŸ’µ (see below)
- [ ] Implement a function `averageTransaction` that determines the average withdrawal and deposit amounts ðŸ’°. _IMPORTANT: Only approved transactions count towards the total!_. It should return an object that looks like

  ```js
  {
    deposit: number,
    withdrawal: number
  }
  ```

- [ ] Use the `Date` object to incorporate a key `time` into the transactions ðŸ“…

A single transaction should be represented by an object. For instance:

```js
const exampleDeposit = {
  type: "deposit",
  amount: 1000,
  before: 500,
  after: 1500,
  status: "approved"
};

const exampleWithdrawal = {
  type: "withdrawal",
  amount: 1000,
  before: 520,
  after: 520,
  status: "denied"
};
```

Transaction history, for instance:

```js
const account = accountGenerator(100);
account.transactionHistory(2); // => [{...}, {...}]
```

  let balance = initial;

        withdrawal.after = balance;
        withdrawal.status = DENIED;
      } 
      withdrawal.time = new Date();
